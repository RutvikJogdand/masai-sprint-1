            <div>Cognition:
                <hr>
                The crocodile is a pretty smart reptile.
                Crocodiles possess some advanced cognitive abilities.
                 They can observe and use patterns of prey behaviour, such as when prey come to the river to
                  drink at the same time each day. Crocodiles use twigs as bait for birds looking for nesting material.

            <div class="FlexBox1Child">Social behaviour and vocalization:
                <hr>
                Crocodiles are the most social of reptiles. Even though they do not form social groups,
                 many species congregate in certain sections of rivers, tolerating each other at times of feeding and basking.

            <div>Longevity:<hr>
               
                The most common method is to measure lamellar growth rings in bones and teeth,each ring corresponds to a 
                change in growth rate which typically occurs once a year.Bearing these inaccuracies
                in mind, it can be safely said that all 
                crocodile species have an average lifespan of 30â€“40 years.

            <div>Size:
                <hr>
                Size greatly varies among species, from the dwarf crocodile to the saltwater crocodile.
                 Species of the dwarf crocodile Osteolaemus grow to an adult size of just 1.5 to 1.9 m (4.9 to 6.2 ft), 
                whereas the saltwater crocodile can grow to sizes over 7 m (23 ft).
