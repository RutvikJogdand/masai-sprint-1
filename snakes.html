            All major continents except:
            <ul>
                <li>Ireland</li>
                <li>Iceland</li>

            <div>Size<hr>
                The now extinct Titanoboa cerrejonensis snakes were 12.8 m (42 ft) in length.By comparison, 
                the largest extant snakes are the reticulated python, which measures about 6.95 m (22.8 ft) long,
                 and the green anaconda, 
                which measures about 5.21 m (17.1 ft) long and is considered the heaviest snake on Earth at 97.5 kg (215 lb).

            <div>Perception<hr>
                Pit vipers, pythons, and some boas have infrared-sensitive receptors in deep grooves on the snout,
                 which allow them to "see" the radiated heat of warm-blooded prey. 
                 In pit vipers, the grooves are located between the nostril and the eye in a large "pit" on each side of the head.
                  Other infrared-sensitive snakes have multiple, 
                smaller labial pits lining the upper lip, just below the nostrils

            <div class="FlexBox1Child">Venom<hr>
                Cobras, vipers, and closely related species use venom to immobilize, injure or kill their prey. 
                The venom is modified saliva, delivered through fangs. The fangs of 'advanced' venomous snakes like viperids 
                and elapids are hollow to inject venom more effectively, while the fangs of rear-fanged snakes such as 
                the boomslang merely have a groove on the posterior edge to channel venom into the wound.
            </div>
            <div>Bite: <hr>
                The treatment for a snakebite is as variable as the bite itself. The most common and effective method is through antivenom
                 (or antivenin), a serum made from the venom of the snake. 
                Some antivenom is species-specific (monovalent) while some is made for use with multiple species in mind (polyvalent)
            </div>
            <div>Medicine: <hr>
                Several compounds from snake venoms are being researched as potential treatments or 
                preventatives for pain, cancers, arthritis, stroke, heart disease, hemophilia, and hypertension, 
                and to control bleeding (e.g. during surgery).
