            <div>Change of color:<hr>
                Some chameleon species are able to change their skin colouration. 
                Different chameleon species are able to vary their colouration and pattern through 
                combinations of pink, blue, red, orange, green, black, brown, light blue, yellow, turquoise, and purple. 
               
            </div>
            <div>Reason behind change of color:<hr>
                Chameleon skin has a superficial layer which contains pigments, and under the layer are cells with guanine crystals. 
                Chameleons change colour by changing the space between the guanine crystals, which changes the wavelength of light reflected off the crystals
                 which changes the colour of the skin.</div>

            <div class="FlexBox1Child"> Senses: <hr>
                Chameleons have the most distinctive eyes of any reptile. 
                The upper and lower eyelids are joined, with only a pinhole large enough for the pupil to see through. 
                Each eye can pivot and focus independently, allowing the chameleon to observe two different objects simultaneously. 
                This gives them a full 360-degree arc of vision.
            </div>
            <div>Feeding:<hr>
                All chameleons are primarily insectivores that feed by ballistically projecting their long tongues from their 
                mouths to capture prey located some distance away. The chameleons' tongues
                 are typically thought to be one and a half to two times the length of their bodies 
                 (their length excluding the tail).</div>
            <div>Some interesting characteristics:<hr>
                Certain species of chameleons have bones that glow when under ultraviolet light, also known as biogenic fluorescence.
                Some 31 different species of Calumma chameleons, all native to Madagascar, displayed this fluorescence in CT scans.
                The bones emitted a bright blue glow and could even shine through the chameleon's four layers of skin.
