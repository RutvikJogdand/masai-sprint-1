            <div class="WhatHow"> What are reptiles</div>

            <div class="AnsToWhatHow">Reptiles are cold-blooded,
                 which means that they rely on heat from their surroundings to warm up. 
                 They are vertebrates (animals with backbones) and have dry skin, covered either 
                 with scales or horny plates. Reptiles breathe using lungs. Most species of reptiles 
                 eat other animals, and most lay eggs on land to breed. Reptiles alive today include lizards, 
                 snakes, tortoises, turtles, crocodiles, and alligators.

                <div class="WhatHow"> Why are reptiles important</div>

                <div class="AnsToWhatHow">Reptiles play an important role in the balance of an Ecosystem. 
                    In most ecosystems, reptiles are the vital part of food chains and they play a huge role both as 
                    the prey species and the predators in ecosystems.
                    They also play the role of a pollinator. Many serious agricultural pests were eliminated by the
                     reptiles.
